  note: fast stepping gait, centered zmp

  
- name: params_2015-09-12T00-48-0400.yaml
  note: with starting behavior, mid-size step, higher joint velocity, takes 3 steps in simulation.

- name: params_2015-09-12T00-11-0400.yaml
  note: with starting behavior, using human data as cost function. However, the robot falls at the first step.
